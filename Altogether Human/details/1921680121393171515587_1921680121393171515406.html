Take a look at the diagram below.  I have put myself at the top and plotted the people I know based on the strength of relationship I have with them.  (Click on the image to open in a new window).

Now draw out your own relationship tree.  You may want to sketch it on a piece of paper, or use a piece of software such as 'Word' or 'Paint'.

Whilst you are completing it consider what measurement you are using to measure 'strength of relationship'? 

Is it;

How often you see them?
How much they do for you?
How much you do for them?
or something else?
