However whilst we are rooted in nature there are additional expectations put upon us.

Video

27 So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.

28 God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.”

29 Then God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. 30 And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food.” And it was so.

31 God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day."   

Genesis 1: 27 - 31 NIV

So we are called to be more than just creatures.  
From the beginning we were given a role in his creation.  
To be custodians of all that was created and tend to HIS work
"The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it." Genesis 1: 15 NIV
