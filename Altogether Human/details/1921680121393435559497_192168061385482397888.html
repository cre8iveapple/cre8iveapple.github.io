We hear and see a lot about superstars such as Beyonce.  But what we do not hear is about the spiritual lives of these superstars.  The tabloids are quick to cover an indiscretion, upcoming album or fashion faux pas.  But what about Faith.  Beyonce was raised a Methodist Christian and has a faith on god.  A quick search on the internet shows how speculative people are about her faith.
Whether or not she is a Christian is her privet business, but it can make us ask two questions of ourselves.
Do we hide our Christianity as something privet, or do we live a proud Christian life?
If someone searched our lives on-line would they know if we are Christian or not?  Are we narrow casting ourselves on-line?
