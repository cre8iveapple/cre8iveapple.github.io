            <p>As a Joint Degree Student part way through my studies I started trying to decide whether I wanted to work in Education or IT, but really it was not a decision that needed to be made.  The world of IT in education is so vast and  varied that the question I should have been asking was what area of IT in Education do I want to work in. This question remained mainly unanswered until quite recently on the completion of my Final Year Project. </p> 
            <p>The title of my project was “Engaging VLE Design”  and questioned how aspects of engagement could be considered at the design stages of an online course.  </p> 
            <p>The final result of the paper was a Design Verification Document and a Course Design.  The Design Verification Document included  a range of aspects that should be included in the design to facilitate engagement amongst students on the course.  However the course I designed fell short of these requirements, my conclusion highlighted the main area of weakness not in my understanding of modelling techniques or the underlying peadagogy but in the actual process of taking a subject area, creating learning objectives and designing content to meet those learning objectives.  In short I am not a teacher…yet. </p> 
            <p>It is this in mind that I apply for the current Graduate Teaching Assistant position.

           <h2>6SN004	A Critical Approach to Bullying in Schools</h2>
           <p>Schools are complex social systems that have a powerful effect on behaviour as well as learning. A great deal of research has been carried out on bullying, but it focuses largely on individual children's behaviour. Less research has looked at the ways in which schools themselves can cause behavioural problems between pupils through what they expect pupils to do, and how they go about rewarding and punishing the way pupils do it. This module takes a highly unusual approach to the problem of bullying, and develops students' political awareness through the use of images rather than words. To demonstrate your achievement in the learning outcomes you will produce a piece of artwork instead of the usual written assignment.</p>

              <p>The homework set was to <EM>Choose a book, read it and and write a book blurb.</EM>  
              <p>I adapted the homework too make a movie of a book blurb.  Bella was highly motivated by the oppertunity to make a movie. </p>
              <p> She read two or three books whilst choosing and wrote out the headings that would be used. At this point she had technically compleated the homework but the motivating factor was to go on to produce the movie.  Without this motivating factor it would have been segnigicantly more difficult to encourage her to complete the work.
