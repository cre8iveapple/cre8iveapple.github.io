        <p>Over the past 7 years I have been studying a Joint Honors Degree in Computing and Special Needs and Inclusion Studies.  I have a passion for IT in Education and Training. </p> 
        <p>The title of my final project was “Engaging VLE Design”  and questioned how aspects of engagement could be considered at the design stages of an online course.  The final result of the paper was a Design Verification Document and a Course Design. </p> 
        <p>Over the last two years I have worked at Bishop Walsh Catholic School to develop their visual media within school and on their website.  I currently run a multi-site installation of WordPress running both public and private sites throughout many different departments.  Some sites are ongoing, some are 'pop-up' sites to cover a specific event.  </p> 
        <p>  
I feel I have a good grounding in areas of computing and pedagogy, however I consider an area for personal improvement is the visual design of my work.  With this in mind I am currently applying to study for my Post Graduate Diploma Digital and Visual Communications part time, with a view to extending it to a Masters Degree. </p>

        <p>Makaton signing for babies is a fun and easy way to learn to sign with your baby.</p> 
        <p>Signing while speaking has been shown to encourage the development of communication and language skills. It can help reduce frustrations and help you to understand your baby’s needs and wants.</p> <img alt="The symbols for nappy, potty, and toys" title="The symbols for nappy, potty, and toys" class="floatRight" src="images/baby-signs2.gif" /> 
        <p>Makaton signing for babies is provided as a series of sessions for you and your baby. Together you will learn up to 100 signs and symbols and have fun practising them in songs, games and activities.</p> 
        <p>Participants receive a pocket book of signs and symbols covering the vocabulary learned in the course, and approximately 30 other concepts that parents of young children often request.</p> <em>Why not have a go and enjoy the benefits of signing with your baby.</em> <h3>Duration</h3> 
        <p>Six sessions.</p> <h3>Recommended for</h3> 
        <p>Recommended for parents, family members, carers or members of professional teams who would like to sign with babies and children in their care and have no previous experience of Makaton. </p>

      <div class="content hidden"> <button id="close" onclick="divHide()" type="button">X</button> <h2>6SN004	A Critical Approach to Bullying in Schools</h2> 
        <p>Schools are complex social systems that have a powerful effect on behaviour as well as learning. A great deal of research has been carried out on bullying, but it focuses largely on individual children's behaviour. Less research has looked at the ways in which schools themselves can cause behavioural problems between pupils through what they expect pupils to do, and how they go about rewarding and punishing the way pupils do it. This module takes a highly unusual approach to the problem of bullying, and develops students' political awareness through the use of images rather than words. To demonstrate your achievement in the learning outcomes you will produce a piece of artwork instead of the usual written assignment.</p> <img alt="Samantha Aplin" style="max-height: 50%;" src="http://cre8iveapple.co.uk/sam/stuff/final.jpg" />

          <p> Here is an example of adapting my daughters homework for school. </p> 
          <p>The homework set was to <em>Choose a book, read it and and write a book blurb.</em> </p> 
          <p>I adapted the homework too make a movie of a book blurb.  Bella was highly motivated by the oppertunity to make a movie. </p> 
          <p> She read two or three books whilst choosing and wrote out the headings that would be used. At this point she had technically compleated the homework but the motivating factor was to go on to produce the movie.  Without this motivating factor it would have been segnigicantly more difficult to encourage her to complete the work.

<h2>Stories</h2> 
        <p> Here are two of my most popular stories.  Each includes audiance participation and a wide variety of signs. </p> <h3>Smartest Pirate</h3> 
        <p>An adaptation of the well known book by Julia Donaldson, the giant pirate gets some new clothes that <img alt="Sammy dresses up as a pirate" title="Sammy dresses up as a pirate" class="floatLeft" src="images/pirate.JPG" />make him the smartest in town.  But when he comes accross some friends in trouble what will he do?  A story about helping others.  Includes lots of animal signs, focus on signs for help and thank you. Lots of audiance participation and singing.  Plenty of scope for follow up lesson activities.</p> <h3>Hungry Catterpillar</h3> <img alt="Sammy makes a variety of props" title="Sammy makes a variety of props" class="floatRight" src="images/caterpillar.jpg" /> 
        <p>Loosely based on Eric Carle's The Hungry Catterpillar. The children enjoy chosing food and feeding the catterpillar. Lots of scope for children to find the correct foods, can be prompted by signs, sympols or photos to aid understanding. </p> <h3>New stories are added all the time or I can create a story to suit your needs.</h3>

        <ul>Aug 2012 - Apr 2016<br />		John Paul II Multi Accademy  - Librarian / Ict Technician
  <li>My primary area of responsibility within the IT department is Digital
Communications and Online Learning. 
Alongside assisting in the general upkeep of IT equipment in school, duties
include building and maintaining systems, and training in the following
areas,<br />- VLE<br />- Digital signage<br />- Website<br />- Google Apps<br /> During my time at the school I have facilitated moving from Zimbra email
platform to Gmail and currently redesigning our website and facilitating the
migration of our VLE from FROG to Moodle.
Most of my work is independent, supervised by the Network manager but in
an open environment where views and opinions are shared. 
On starting at the school, the email system in use was outdated so the staff
needed to be quickly moved over to Gmail to continue an effective
communications system within the school. On rolling out the new email
system I discovered a range of teachers who had never accessed the email
system and were unsure of how and why email was used within the school.
A mix of open workshops and '1 to 1' sessions enabled these teachers to
conquer their fears and access a system that was previously closed to
them.
My role as school Librarian complements my work in the IT department. 
The LRC is more than a Library, it is a hub for accessing information. As
Librarian my role includes cataloguing the books but also assisting the
Students and Staff, offering opportunities for IT support and training.  </li>

				Wolverhampton University
         
          <li>In my role at King Edwards I am responsible for the main support to teachers under the advice and guidance of the network manager.  Daily issues regarding both hardware and  software are dealt with in a timely manner often independently.  I oversee 28 wireless access points, 45 projectors, 45 smartboards, 110 thin clients, 158 laptops and 38 printers.  
I also carry out routine network administration tasks such as creating accounts, deleting duplicated profiles, uploading new software.   During these routine tasks I occasionally come across oddities which I will look into, report to the network manager and carryout any necessary fixes. 
More complex issues are worked on jointly with the network manager to gain further experience.  The server is a virtualised windows 2008 server system with CITRIX XEN server and XEN apps for thin clients.</li>
