<h2>FizzPix</h2> 
 
 <p> FizzPix was funded by my company Cre8iveApple.  It was a group project that I opened up to all fizzpop members to assist with.  We exhibited it at Electro Magnetic Field.  
</p>

<p>The final piece is displayed in the entrance to Fizzpop Makerspace in Birmingham.   It is currently controlled through a web interface hosted on the internal raspberry pi to change the animation.   
</p>

<p>It has also been on display at 'Geek Up' a gaming event at The Midlands Arts Centre. For which it was reprogrammed with a popular block game.
