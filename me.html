            <p>The title of my final project was “Engaging VLE Design”  and questioned how aspects of engagement could be considered at the design stages of an online course.  The final result of the paper was a Design Verification Document and a Course Design.

            <p>I have experienced IT in a professional capacity during my time as an IT Techncian alongside my studies.  I have developed a small Buisiness developing creative solutions for artists and makers.  This untilised my skills as a designer, a maker, a programmer and buisiness woman.  My GNVQ in retail and time studuing hospitality at university has given me a keen sence of customer service.
