                <li>James Brindley Academy is a unique school spread across 10 sites.  Some sites are school centres where pupils attend daily, some are residential units in hospital settings and others are set in general medical hospitals.   	   	  <br />  My role has been in 3 of the centres so far.  One a residential unit for young people who have Social, Emotional and Mental Health Needs; one a school where pupils with Social, Emotional and Mental Health Needs and the third was based in Birmingham Children’s Hospital.   	  <br />  Due to the diverse nature of these settings and the pupils who attend it has been important to develop a highly responsive and adaptable teaching style.

              Aug 2012 - Apr 2016
              <li>My primary area of responsibility within the IT department is Digital Communications and Online Learning.  Alongside assisting in the general upkeep of IT equipment in school, duties include building and maintaining systems, and training in the following areas,<br />- VLE<br />- Digital signage<br />- Website<br />- Google Apps<br /> During my time at the school I have facilitated moving from Zimbra email platform to Gmail and currently redesigning our website and facilitating the migration of our VLE from FROG to Moodle. Most of my work is independent, supervised by the Network manager but in an open environment where views and opinions are shared.  On starting at the school, the email system in use was outdated so the staff needed to be quickly moved over to Gmail to continue an effective communications system within the school. On rolling out the new email system I discovered a range of teachers who had never accessed the email system and were unsure of how and why email was used within the school. A mix of open workshops and '1 to 1' sessions enabled these teachers to conquer their fears and access a system that was previously closed to them. My role as school Librarian complements my work in the IT department.  The LRC is more than a Library, it is a hub for accessing information. As Librarian my role includes cataloguing the books but also assisting the Students and Staff, offering opportunities for IT support and training.

              <li>In my role at King Edwards I am responsible for the main support to teachers under the advice and guidance of the network manager.  Daily issues regarding both hardware and  software are dealt with in a timely manner often independently.

I also carry out routine network administration tasks such as creating accounts, deleting duplicated profiles, uploading new software.   During these routine tasks I occasionally come across oddities which I will look into, report to the network manager and carryout any necessary fixes.  More complex issues are worked on jointly with the network manager to gain further experience.  The server is a virtualised windows 2008 server system with CITRIX XEN server and XEN apps for thin clients.
